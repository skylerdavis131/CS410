Does our shell need to know how to compile the matmult_p.c and matmult_t.c programs or will these functions already be compiled before running the shell program?

How do we read control-c and control-d as inputs?
	-Always be checking for these in the shell when a process is running and then if they occure send the desired actions to the processes?
