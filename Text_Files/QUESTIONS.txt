Does our shell need to know how to compile the matmult_p.c and matmult_t.c programs or will these functions already be compiled before running the shell program?

Can we assume that EOF is one its own line when input to myshell is piped from another file, or should we check for this?

Why can't I just use execvp instead of execve?
