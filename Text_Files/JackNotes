Lab Notes:
	+ Check all stat, lstat, and fstat varaitions to find what they do.
	+ Read the fork() man pages
		+ What features are/arent inherited from the parent?
	+ whenever we exit the shell, clean up the child processes
	+ User defined signals: SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2
	+ Kill() is used to send a signal to any process
	+ read signal() man pages
