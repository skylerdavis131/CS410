Lab Notes:
	+ Check all stat, lstat, and fstat varaitions to find what they do.
	+ Read the fork() man pages
		+ What features are/arent inherited from the parent?
	+ whenever we exit the shell, clean up the child processes
	+ User defined signals: SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2
	+ Kill() is used to send a signal to any process
	+ read signal() man pages


SHELL EXECUTE LOOP SUDO CODE:
i = 0;
nT = 0; //oldest namedToken index we have yet to execute
while(args[i] != '/0') //loop through each commandline argument
	Find the next command token

	if(no command tokens)
		execute on args[0] with the argument array of the entire args
			array
		shell should wait for exec to stop before continueing
		update nT

	else if(command token == ';')
		execute on args[nT] with an argument array of all arguments
			between nT and i == ';'
		shell should wait for exec to stop before continueing
		update nT

	else if(command token == '>' )
		exec( args[nT] ) with an argument array of all arguments between
			nT and i== '>'
			+ redirect stdout to file with name at args[i + 1]
		shell should wait for exec to stop before continueing
		update nT

	else if(command token == '1>')
		exec( args[nT] ) with an argument array of all arguments between
			nT and i== '1>'
			+ redirect stdout to file with name at args[i + 1]
		shell should wait for exec to stop before continueing
		update nT

	else if(command token == '2>')
		exec( args[nT] ) with an argument array of all arguments between
			nT and i== '2>'
			+ redirect stderr to file with name at args[i + 1]
		shell should wait for exec to stop before continueing
		update nT

	else if(command token == '&>')
		exec( args[nT] ) with an argument array of all arguments between
			nT and i== '&>'
			+ redirect stderr and stdout to file with name at args[i + 1]
		shell should wait for exec to stop before continueing
		update nT

	else if(command token == '<')
		exec( args[nT] ) with an argument array of all arguments between
			nT and i== '<'
			+ take stdin from the file with name at args[i + 1] instead
				of taking input from terminal
		shell should wait for exec to stop before continueing
		update nT

	else if(command token == '|')
		exec( args[nT] ) with an argument array of all arguments between
			nT and i== '|'
		pipe the output of args[nT] into the input of args[i + 1]
		shell should wait for exec to stop before continueing
		update nT;

	else if(command token == '&')
		exec( args[nT] ) with an argument array of all arguments between
			nT and i== '|'
		process should run in background, ie shell doesnt wait for exec
			to finish before continuing
		update nT

	else
		DETERMINE SOME DEFAULT ACTION
